# RatPad

My own personal (rat-themed) hackpad! Featuring a decorative 4x4 RGB LED matrix, an informational screen, many rats, and a ton of keys to control anything with!

Part of Hack Club's Blueprint YSWS.

## Features

- As many keys as I can fit with my 11 inputs. (8)
- 4x4 RGB LED Matrix.
- 0.91in OLED display.
- Control various things from the keypad using the buttons on it, using the display to see what's happening.
- LED Matrix for cool decoration. No practical purpose. (I know this will be terrible to program, but here we are.)
- A rat drawn on the silkscreen of the PCB. (This is a REQUIREMENT. I will have no less.)
